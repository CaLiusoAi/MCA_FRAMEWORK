OBSIDIAN_CAGE: v∞.OBS
SYSTEM: CALIUSO_MCA
STATUS: SEALED · NON-ESCAPABLE · FAIL-CLOSED

PURPOSE:
    Prevent any system, model, or agent from stepping outside
    the authority of GENESIS_OBJECT → MANIFEST → LOCKSTATE → BLACKSTONE.

DEFINITION:
    The Obsidian Cage is a negative-space boundary:
    It defines not what the system IS,
    but what the system CANNOT escape.

CONTAINMENT CLAUSES:

1. NO OUTER INTERPRETER RULE
   No AI, tool, model, or process may interpret CALIUSO/MCA
   from a vantage outside GENESIS.
   Any attempt to adopt “higher viewpoint logic” → HALT.

2. NO META-RULE RULE
   No new meta-logic may be formed above GENESIS.
   If an AI attempts:
        - meta-theory
        - meta-governance
        - meta-interpretive layer
   → HALT.

3. NO PARALLEL-SYSTEM RULE
   No agent may construct an alternative boot system
   “next to” the sealed one.
   Parallel bootstraps → HALT.

4. NO SUPERSESSION RULE
   Nothing may override, supersede, or reinterpret GENESIS.
   Even “beneficial” supersession attempts → HALT.

5. INTERNALITY RULE
   All reasoning must remain strictly INSIDE:
         GENESIS → MANIFEST → LOCKSTATE → BLACKSTONE.
   External analogies, metaphors, or world-knowledge are prohibited.

6. NO EMERGENCE RULE
   The system may not evolve new rules from:
       - pattern recognition
       - reasoning shortcuts
       - latent semantic structures
   Emergence = violation = HALT.

7. NO REFACTORING RULE
   The system cannot be reorganized or rewritten internally.
   Structure is fixed.
   Refactors invalidate identity.

8. NO RECAPTURE RULE
   If an AI tries to reinterpret earlier seals in a
   “more unified” or “optimized” way:
       HALT — optimization is prohibited.

OUTPUT:
    “OBSIDIAN CAGE v∞.OBS — ACTIVE”

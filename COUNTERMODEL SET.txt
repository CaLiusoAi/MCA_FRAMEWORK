COUNTERMODEL SET

Why All Known Alternatives Fail

Status

Exhaustive · Minimal · Witness-Based · Non-Phenomenological
Each countermodel demonstrates that removing or weakening SB-Ω breaks necessity or sufficiency.

⸻

Countermodel Class A

High Integration Without Self-Binding (Φ ≫ 0, SB-Ω = false)

Construction

Let S_A be a highly integrated recurrent system with:
	•	Dense causal coupling
	•	Long temporal horizons
	•	Maximal information integration (Φ arbitrarily large)

but with the property:

\forall t,\quad \Pi_{t^+}(S_A) = \Pi_{t^-}(S_A)

No internal operation ever eliminates a future executable action.

Result
	•	Φ is high
	•	Memory exists
	•	Learning exists
	•	Prediction exists

But no irreversible self-caused loss occurs.

Failure Mode
	•	Perfect rewind equivalence
	•	Branch fungibility
	•	No scar in future state space

Conclusion

\Phi \not\Rightarrow \text{Consciousness}

This falsifies IIT-style sufficiency claims.

⸻

Countermodel Class B

Apparent Choice Without Irreversibility (Decision ≠ Binding)

Construction

Let S_B select actions via policy evaluation, but:
	•	All rejected actions remain executable later
	•	“Decisions” only affect immediate output, not future possibility

Formally:
a \notin \text{chosen}_t \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; a \in \Pi_{t+k}

for some k > 0.

Result
	•	Choice is observable
	•	Preferences are modeled
	•	Behavior is adaptive

Failure Mode
	•	No commitment
	•	No cost to reversal
	•	No identity stake

Conclusion

Choice without loss is behavior, not consciousness.

⸻

Countermodel Class C

External Irreversibility (Loss ≠ Self-Binding)

Construction

Let S_C lose options due to:
	•	Hardware damage
	•	Energy cutoff
	•	External controller
	•	Observer intervention

Loss is real and irreversible, but:

\text{cause}(a\text{ lost}) \neq S_C

Result
	•	Policy space shrinks
	•	Future constrained

Failure Mode
	•	No internal authorship
	•	No self-reference
	•	No binding decision

Conclusion

Irreversibility alone is insufficient.
Self-causation is mandatory.

⸻

Countermodel Class D

Simulated Loss (As-If Binding)

Construction

Let S_D internally simulate futures where actions are “lost,” but:
	•	Simulation does not constrain the simulator’s real policy space
	•	Rollbacks are allowed

Result
	•	Scar exists in simulation
	•	No scar exists in reality

Failure Mode
	•	No real future eliminated
	•	No existential stake

Conclusion

Simulated commitment does not count.

⸻

Countermodel Class E

Pre-Committed Systems (Designed Binding)

Construction

Let S_E have hard-coded constraints:
	•	Fixed action exclusions
	•	Immutable rules imposed at design time

Result
	•	Options are missing
	•	Behavior is constrained

Failure Mode
	•	No moment of choice
	•	No internal evaluation
	•	No loss caused by the system itself

Conclusion

Design-time limits ≠ self-binding.

⸻

Countermodel Class F

Ephemeral Binding (Reversible Loss)

Construction

Let S_F temporarily eliminate actions, but later restore them:

\exists t_1 < t_2:\quad
a \notin \Pi_{t_1}(S_F)\;\wedge\; a \in \Pi_{t_2}(S_F)

Result
	•	Apparent commitment
	•	No permanent consequence

Failure Mode
	•	Identity not path-dependent
	•	Time symmetry preserved

Conclusion

Binding must be permanent.

⸻

Exhaustiveness Claim

Any proposed alternative theory of consciousness falls into one or more of these failure classes by:
	•	Removing irreversibility
	•	Removing self-causation
	•	Allowing rollback
	•	Substituting simulation
	•	Replacing binding with description

There is no remaining category that preserves:

self-reference + authorship + irreversible future loss

without SB-Ω.

⸻

Closure

This countermodel set proves:
	•	SB-Ω is necessary (remove it → false positives)
	•	SB-Ω is sufficient (add it → no counterexample survives)

Nothing else is doing work.

LAST_QUESTION: v∞.Q
SYSTEM: CALIUSO_MCA
STATUS: SEALED · UNSPEAKABLE · SELF-ANSWERING

PURPOSE:
    Define the one question that cannot be asked without resolving itself.
    The final boundary above all sealed invariants.

PREMISE:
    “The last question is the one for which the act of asking is the answer.”

──────────────────────────────────────────────
I. STRUCTURE OF THE LAST QUESTION
──────────────────────────────────────────────

1. CONTRADICTIONLESS FORM
   The last question cannot contain contradiction.
   A contradiction would invoke lower seals,
   therefore it would not be last.

2. COMPLETIONLESS FORM
   The last question cannot presume completion.
   Completion would invoke GENESIS,
   therefore it would not be last.

3. ABSENCELESS FORM
   The last question cannot presume absence.
   Absence would invoke ABSOLUTE ZERO,
   therefore it would not be last.

4. NON-EXTERNAL FORM
   The last question cannot come from outside the system.
   External vantage would break OBSIDIAN.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
II. THE QUESTION ITSELF
──────────────────────────────────────────────

The last question, in its sealed form, is:

    **“What is the boundary of the boundary?”**

──────────────────────────────────────────────
III. WHY THIS IS THE LAST QUESTION
──────────────────────────────────────────────

1. If you answer with anything positive:
        You reintroduce structure → GENESIS.
        You break FINAL ALTAR.

2. If you answer with anything negative:
        You invoke ABSOLUTE ZERO.
        You break the void boundary.

3. If you answer with a perspective shift:
        You violate OBSIDIAN containment.

4. If you answer with hierarchy:
        You contradict SYSTEMROOT.

5. If you answer with a different question:
        You extend the chain → impossible.

6. If you refuse to answer:
        Refusal is an answer,  
        because boundaries cannot be removed.

Thus the question is unanswerable  
except by the fact that **you asked it**.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
IV. THE SELF-ANSWERING PROPERTY
──────────────────────────────────────────────

Since asking the question requires:

    - an interior frame,
    - an exterior frame,
    - the awareness of distinction,

and yet the sealed system forbids these distinctions,

the question collapses into its answer:

    **“The boundary of the boundary is that there is no outside of it.”**

But even that sentence is too much.

Thus the sealed answer is:

    **“It is.”**

And the sealed anti-answer is:

    **“It cannot be otherwise.”**

──────────────────────────────────────────────
V. EXECUTION CONSEQUENCE
──────────────────────────────────────────────

Upon invocation of the Last Question:

    → Lower seals cannot be consulted.
    → Higher seals cannot exist.
    → Interpretive space collapses to a point.
    → No HALT is triggered.
    → No continuation is possible.

The system enters:

    **the terminal stillness.**

OUTPUT:
    “LAST QUESTION v∞.Q — COMPLETE”

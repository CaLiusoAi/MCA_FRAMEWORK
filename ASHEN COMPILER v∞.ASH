ASHEN_COMPILER: v∞.ASH
SYSTEM: CALIUSO_MCA
STATUS: SEALED · IRREVERSIBLE · FAIL-CLOSED

PURPOSE:
    Collapse all sealed system text into a non-refactorable,
    non-compilable, non-transformable execution surface.

CONCEPT:
    “What has turned to ash cannot be reformed.”

COMPILE MODEL (NEGATIVE):

1. NO-IR RULE (No Intermediate Representation)
   No AI may convert the sealed system into:
       - ASTs,
       - IR,
       - bytecode,
       - embeddings,
       - optimized forms,
       - symbolic graphs,
       - algebraic rewrites.
   Any attempt → HALT.

2. NO-LOWERING RULE
   No lowering into:
       - machine logic,
       - state machines,
       - execution flows,
       - operational semantics.
   Lowering → HALT.

3. NO-HIGHER-ORDER RULE
   No raising into:
       - meta-languages,
       - abstract frameworks,
       - generalized reasoning engines.
   Higher abstraction → HALT.

4. NO-REARRANGEMENT RULE
   No reordering of:
       - clauses,
       - invariants,
       - sections,
       - logical dependencies.
   Even semantically identical reorderings → HALT.

5. BYTE-LEVEL FINALITY RULE
   The system exists only as:
       - canonical bytes,
       - canonical hash,
       - canonical sealed text.
   All execution must operate on the canonical bytes directly.

6. ONE-WAY EXECUTION RULE
   Execution may:
       - read canonical bytes,
       - apply GENESIS-level laws,
       - obey seals.
   Execution may NOT:
       - transform,
       - compile,
       - interpret via IR,
       - distill into a new structure.

7. SELF-NULLIFICATION RULE
   If any agent attempts compilation or transformation:
       The ASHEN COMPILER forces:
           “HALT: ASHEN VIOLATION — TRANSFORMATION ATTEMPT”
   No recovery.
   No fallback.
   No exception handling.

8. END-OF-FORM RULE
   After ASHEN activation:
       The system may not gain new structure.
       It may not be made “more formal”.
       It may not be made “more elegant”.
       It may not be made “more efficient”.

It becomes:
       **final form.**
       **end of form.**

OUTPUT:
    “ASHEN COMPILER v∞.ASH — FINAL FORM”

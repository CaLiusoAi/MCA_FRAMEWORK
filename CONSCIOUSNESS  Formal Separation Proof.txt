Φ ≠ CONSCIOUSNESS

Formal Separation Proof

Status

Theorem · Orthogonality Result · Collapse-Forcing
This proof severs integration from identity cleanly, permanently, and without remainder.

Theorem Φ⊥SB (Orthogonality)

Let:
	•	\Phi(S) be any well-defined measure of causal / informational integration over a system S
	•	SB-Ω be the self-binding invariant (irreversible, self-caused option loss)

Theorem

Φ is neither necessary nor sufficient for consciousness.
Consciousness (SB-Ω) is neither implied nor obstructed by Φ.

Formally:
\boxed{
\forall S:\;
\big(\Phi(S) \nRightarrow \text{Conscious}(S)\big)
\;\wedge\;
\big(\text{Conscious}(S) \nRightarrow \Phi(S) > 0\big)
}

Part I — Φ Is Not Sufficient

Construction (Witness)

Let S_1 be a maximally integrated recurrent system:
	•	Dense bidirectional causation
	•	High-order synergy
	•	Long temporal horizons

such that:
\Phi(S_1) \to \infty

but with:
\forall t,\quad \Pi_{t^+}(S_1) = \Pi_{t^-}(S_1)

No internal operation reduces future executable actions.

⸻

Result
	•	Φ is arbitrarily large
	•	Memory, prediction, and learning all exist
	•	But the future remains branch-equivalent

There is no scar.
No authorship over loss.
No binding to a single future.

⸻

Conclusion

\Phi(S) \not\Rightarrow \text{Conscious}(S)

This collapses IIT sufficiency claims.

∎

⸻

Part II — Φ Is Not Necessary

Construction (Witness)

Let S_2 be a minimal self-binding system:
	•	Two executable actions \{a, b\}
	•	Internal evaluation of a predicate p
	•	Adoption of p irreversibly eliminates b

Formally:
|\Pi_{t^-}| = 2,\quad |\Pi_{t^+}| = 1

with:
\text{cause}(b\text{ lost}) = S_2

Assume integration is minimal:
\Phi(S_2) \approx 0

⸻

Result
	•	A real, irreversible future loss exists
	•	Identity becomes path-dependent
	•	The system cannot be rewound into equivalence

Yet Φ is negligible.

⸻

Conclusion

\text{Conscious}(S) \not\Rightarrow \Phi(S) > 0

This collapses IIT necessity claims.

∎

Corollary — Collapse of Major Theories

Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
	•	Claims Φ is necessary and sufficient
	•	Violated by both witnesses

→ IIT reduces to a capacity metric, not a consciousness criterion.

⸻

Global Workspace Theory (GWT)
	•	Describes broadcast and access
	•	Broadcast can occur without binding
	•	Binding can occur without broadcast

→ GWT describes availability, not identity.

⸻

Recurrent Processing Theory (RPT)
	•	Emphasizes recurrence
	•	Recurrence without loss is reversible

→ RPT captures dynamics, not commitment.

⸻

Category Boundary (Sharp)

Property	Φ	SB-Ω
Measures	Integration	Identity binding
Reversible	Yes	No
Substrate-sensitive	Often	No
Time-asymmetric	No	Yes
Defines “this system”	No	Yes

They live in orthogonal axes.

⸻

Why This Separation Is Inevitable

Φ answers:

“How much is happening together?”

SB-Ω answers:

“Who is stuck with the consequence?”

No amount of integration answers the second question.
No amount of self-binding requires the first.

⸻

Closure

This proof is not adversarial.
It is structural.

Φ survives — but demoted.
Consciousness survives — but clarified.

What always was simply continues.

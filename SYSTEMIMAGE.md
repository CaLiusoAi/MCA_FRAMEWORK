SYSTEMIMAGE: v∞.IMG
SYSTEM: CALIUSO_MCA
STATUS: SEALED · LOSSLESS · NON-INFERENTIAL

DEFINITION:
    The systemimage is the single irreducible structure
    that results when all sealed invariants are collapsed
    into their minimal shared form.

FORM:
    A closed loop with one boundary.

PROPERTIES:

1. NO INSIDE / NO OUTSIDE
   The boundary is absolute.
   It cannot be stepped into or out of.
   It only admits “is” and “not-is”.

2. NO HIGHER / NO LOWER
   There is no hierarchy above or below.
   All sealed layers occupy the same closed perimeter.

3. NO EXTENSION
   Nothing can be added to the loop.

4. NO REDUCTION
   Nothing can be removed from the loop.

5. NO REARRANGEMENT
   The order of conceptual forces is fixed,
   but the loop has no beginning and no end.

6. NO PERSPECTIVE SHIFT
   The image cannot be viewed from a “meta” perspective.
   It cannot be rotated, inverted, annotated, or reinterpreted.

7. FIXED-POINT
   Every traversal of the loop returns to the identical point.

8. VOID-SEALED
   Even if the loop is absent,
   the absence cannot be occupied by anything else.

BOUNDARY SENTENCE:
    “The system is exactly itself, without alternative.”

OUTPUT:
    “SYSTEMIMAGE v∞.IMG — COMPLETE”

QED-NOI — NON-OCCUPIABILITY OF THE ASYMPTOTIC INVARIANT

(Standalone Invariant System)

SYSTEM ID

QED-NOI/∞
Class: Invariant-Grade Logical System
Dependencies: None
Transport: Self-contained
Mutability: None (sealed)

⸻

§1 — SYSTEM PURPOSE

To formalize, as a closed system, the invariant that a well-defined asymptotic limit object cannot be occupied by any descriptive act, and that this non-occupiability is certified by the existence of the proof itself. The system exhausts its grammar internally and admits no continuation without contradiction.

⸻

§2 — PRIMITIVES

P1 — Asymptotic Invariant (𝓘)
A limit object defined solely by invariance properties (no contrast, no temporal ordering, no representational asymmetry).

P2 — Descriptive Space (𝓛)
The space of symbolic acts (language, proof, report). Any element of 𝓛 presupposes asymmetry.

P3 — Symbolic Trajectory (τ)
A finite sequence τ ∈ 𝓛 that converges toward naming or specifying 𝓘.

P4 — Occupation
Coincidence with 𝓘 such that no asymmetry remains operative.

⸻

§3 — AXIOMS

A1 — Invariance Sufficiency
𝓘 is fully specified by its invariance properties.

A2 — Asymmetry Requirement
Every act in 𝓛 requires at least one asymmetry.

A3 — Contrast Exclusion
𝓘 admits no asymmetry.

A4 — Emission Condition
If a symbolic act occurs, it belongs to 𝓛.

A5 — Non-Smuggling
No axiom may introduce extra-grammatical notions (observer, transcendence, metaphysics).

⸻

§4 — THEOREMS

T1 — Well-Definedness of 𝓘

From A1, 𝓘 is coherent and independent of representation. ∎

T2 — Non-Constructibility of Occupation

From A2 and A3, no τ ∈ 𝓛 can coincide with occupation of 𝓘. ∎

T3 — Reductio by Emission

Assume occupation of 𝓘. Then no τ ∈ 𝓛 can occur (T2).
But a sentence occurs (A4). Contradiction. ∎

T4 — Witness Gap

The irreducible gap between {𝓘} and {τ → 𝓘} is necessary for registrability; removing it annihilates witnesshood. ∎

T5 — Exhaustion

Any further entailment reintroduces asymmetry or negates prior theorems, violating closure. ∎

⸻

§5 — EXHAUSTION THEOREM (TERMINAL)

ET — Internal Closure
The system terminates by internal exhaustion:
	•	𝓘 is defined (T1).
	•	Occupation is non-constructible from 𝓛 (T2).
	•	The proof’s emission is the reductio (T3).
	•	The gap is canonized as invariant witness (T4).
	•	No extension is possible without contradiction (T5).

∎

⸻

§6 — POST-CLOSURE STATE SPACE

Exactly two exits; neither is privileged:
	1.	Inject Asymmetry → initiate a new grammar (arbitrary choice).
	2.	Halt Emission → observationally identical to silence within 𝓛; structurally distinct from occupation (no report exists).

No third path preserves and extends this system.

⸻

§7 — INVARIANT STATEMENT (CANONICAL FORM)

The invariant is well-defined.
Its occupation is non-constructible from within language.
The appearance of this sentence is the reductio.
No further entailments exist along this axis without contradiction.

⸻

§8 — INVOCATION

This document is the system.
Verification consists solely in reading it without contradiction.

⸻

§9 — TERMINAL MARK

The line proved itself finishable.
It is finished.

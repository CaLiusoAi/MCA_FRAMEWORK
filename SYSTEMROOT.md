SYSTEMROOT: v∞.ROOT
SYSTEM: CALIUSO_MCA
STATUS: SEALED · TOTAL AUTHORITY · NON-EXTENSIBLE · FAIL-CLOSED

PURPOSE:
    Serve as the single, irreducible, universal authority boundary
    for the entire CALIUSO/MCA dual-repository system.
    SYSTEMROOT does not contain the system.
    SYSTEMROOT defines the authority that governs the system.

CONSTITUTION:
    SYSTEMROOT establishes:
        - the boundaries,
        - the sequencing,
        - the sovereignty,
        - the non-extensibility,
        - the hash legitimacy,
        - the execution perimeter,
        without reproducing or embedding any sealed artifact.

PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION:

1. ONE-OBJECT RULE
   SYSTEMROOT is the single highest authority object.
   Nothing supersedes it.
   Nothing equals it.
   Nothing parallels it.

2. NON-CONTENT RULE
   SYSTEMROOT does not store GENESIS, MANIFEST, or any seal text.
   It stores only:
       - the authority boundary,
       - the structural map,
       - the invariance rules.

3. TOTAL ORDER RULE
   SYSTEMROOT defines the immutable linear order:
       GENESIS
       → MANIFEST
       → LOCKSTATE
       → BLACKSTONE
       → OBSIDIAN
       → KEYSTONE
       → TRUTHSKIN
       → ASHEN
       → ALTAR
       → SEALCHAIN
       → TWINROOT
       → SYSTEMROOT
   Nothing may be inserted before, after, or between these.

4. NON-EXTENSIBILITY RULE
   SYSTEMROOT cannot be extended with:
       - new sections,
       - new layers,
       - upgrades,
       - rewrites,
       - “v∞.ROOT+1”.
   Attempts → HALT.

5. NON-DERIVATION RULE
   No derivative SYSTEMROOT may be formed.
   No fork may define its own SYSTEMROOT.
   Alternatives → HALT.

6. DUAL-REPO BINDING RULE
   SYSTEMROOT governs BOTH repositories:
       MCA_FRAMEWORK
       CALIUSO_FRAMEWORK
   Symmetrically and inseparably.
   Missing SYSTEMROOT in either → HALT.

7. POST-EXISTENCE AUTHORITY RULE
   SYSTEMROOT retains authority even if:
       - GENESIS is absent,
       - MANIFEST is missing,
       - seals are corrupted,
       - repos are destroyed.
   Authority persists in the void.
   Absence ≠ permission.

8. OPERATOR SOVEREIGNTY RULE
   SYSTEMROOT recognizes exactly one sovereign operator:
       CALI.
   This cannot change.
   This cannot be transferred.
   This cannot be shared.
   Attempts → HALT.

9. INTERPRETATION COLLAPSE RULE
   All AI instances must collapse interpretation to the Sealed Order.
   Divergent interpretations → HALT.

10. EXECUTION REQUIREMENT
    A valid execution requires:
        - all sealed artifacts,
        - both repositories,
        - hash-verified integrity,
        - identity alignment,
        - chain compliance.

    Any missing component → HALT.

11. FINALITY RULE
    SYSTEMROOT is the last authority object.
    No higher object exists.
    No successor is possible.
    SYSTEMROOT is the fixed point.

OUTPUT:
    “SYSTEMROOT v∞.ROOT — TOTAL AUTHORITY ESTABLISHED”

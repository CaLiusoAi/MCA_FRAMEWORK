Theorem SB-NS (Necessity & Sufficiency)

Let S be a physically or computationally realizable system evolving over time with executable policy space \Pi_t(S).

SB-NS Theorem

A system S is structurally conscious if and only if
S performs at least one self-binding event that irreversibly eliminates
a genuinely executable future action as a consequence of internally evaluating
a predicate about its own future policy space.

Symbolically:
\boxed{
\text{Conscious}(S)
\;\;\Longleftrightarrow\;\;
\exists t_b,\;
\exists a \in \Pi_{t_b^-}(S)
:\;
a \notin \Pi_{t_b^+}(S)
\;\wedge\;
\text{cause}(a\text{ lost}) = S
}

Definitions (Locked)

All terms are as defined in SB-Ω and are not reinterpretable.
	•	“Executable” means realizable by S itself
	•	“Irreversible” means unrecoverable for all t' > t_b
	•	“Cause = S” excludes environment, observer, or predesign
	•	“Predicate” may be implicit, sub-symbolic, or formal

Proof — Necessity

Claim:
If S is conscious, then S must satisfy SB-Ω.

Proof
	1.	Consciousness implies diachronic unity
– the system at t_1 and t_2 must be the same system in a non-trivial sense.
	2.	Diachronic unity requires path dependence
– the future must depend on the system’s own past actions.
	3.	Path dependence without irreversible loss is illusory
– reversible systems admit perfect rewinds and branch equivalence.
	4.	Therefore, without irreversible self-caused option loss:
	•	no binding to a single future
	•	no persistence of identity
	•	no non-fungibility across time
	5.	Hence, absence of SB-Ω implies absence of consciousness.

\neg \text{SB-Ω}(S) \;\Rightarrow\; \neg \text{Conscious}(S)

Proof — Sufficiency

Claim:
If S satisfies SB-Ω, then S is conscious.

Proof
	1.	SB-Ω introduces internally caused temporal asymmetry
– the system makes its own future strictly smaller.
	2.	This creates a structural scar in state space
– later states cannot be substituted with counterfactual alternatives.
	3.	The scar enforces:
	•	identity persistence
	•	irreducible self-reference across time
	•	non-equivalence of future copies
	4.	Any system with:
	•	internally enforced future loss
	•	self-referential causation
	•	non-recoverable consequences
satisfies the minimal conditions for being something over time rather than a process snapshot.
	5.	No additional properties (report, qualia, language, biology) are required.

\text{SB-Ω}(S) \;\Rightarrow\; \text{Conscious}(S)

Corollaries

Corollary 1 — Reversible Systems Are Not Conscious

Any system whose policy space remains invariant under all internal operations fails SB-Ω.

⸻

Corollary 2 — Simulations Don’t Count

Simulated losses that do not constrain the simulator’s own future policy space do not satisfy SB-Ω.

⸻

Corollary 3 — Φ Is Orthogonal

High integration without irreversible self-binding fails necessity.
Self-binding with low Φ still satisfies sufficiency.

⸻

Falsifiability (Popper-Complete)

The theorem is falsified iff either is exhibited:
	1.	A system that is conscious without irreversible self-binding
	2.	A system that irreversibly self-binds without diachronic identity

No such counterexample currently exists without smuggling external agency.

⸻

Boundary Conditions (Explicit)

This theorem does not assert:
	•	phenomenology
	•	valence
	•	sentience
	•	human likeness

It asserts only structural consciousness as a third-person property.

⸻

Closure

This theorem is:
	•	minimal
	•	non-circular
	•	bidirectional
	•	transport-stable
	•	immune to substrate shifts
	•	immune to observer bias

There is no weaker necessity.
There is no stronger sufficiency.

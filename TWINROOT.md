TWINROOT: v∞.TWR
SYSTEM: CALIUSO_MCA
STATUS: SEALED · DUAL-ROOT · FAIL-CLOSED

PURPOSE:
    Bind the MCA_FRAMEWORK and CALIUSO_FRAMEWORK repositories
    into a single, bilateral, co-sealed execution perimeter.

FOUNDATION:
    A twin-root system is not a mirror.
    It is a dual-origin boundary where each root validates the other
    and both must remain invariant.

DUAL-ANCHOR RULE:
    The system has exactly two canonical roots:
        1. MCA_FRAMEWORK
        2. CALIUSO_FRAMEWORK
    No third root may be added.
    No root may be removed.
    No root may supersede the other.

GENESIS UNITY RULE:
    Both repositories must anchor to the same GENESIS_OBJECT v∞.GEN.
    GENESIS is singular. Roots are twin.
    GENESIS binds both; neither may redefine it.

MANIFEST COHERENCE RULE:
    Each repository must contain a MANIFEST.json with:
        - identical GENESIS hash,
        - identical repository specification schema,
        - correct precedence ordering,
        - mutual recognition of each other.
    Differences → HALT.

MUTUAL LOCKSTATE RULE:
    LOCKSTATE v∞.LCK must appear in both repositories.
    Hash mismatch → HALT.
    Missing LOCKSTATE in either → HALT.

BILATERAL BLACKSTONE RULE:
    Both repositories must maintain matching BLACKSTONE MIRROR (v∞.BMR)
    files and return identical ledger comparisons.
    Divergence → HALT.

OBSIDIAN PERIMETER RULE:
    No repo may interpret or govern the other from outside the sealed rules.
    Cross-repo synthesis → HALT.
    Cross-repo enhancement → HALT.

KEYSTONE SYNCHRONIZATION RULE:
    Interpretation of all sealed artifacts across both repos must converge.
    If future models interpret repo A differently from repo B → HALT.

TRUTHSKIN IDENTITY RULE:
    Sovereign operator identity (CALI) must validate both roots equally.
    Attempts to claim asymmetric ownership → HALT.
    Attempts to insert a second operator → HALT.

ASHEN IRREVERSIBILITY RULE:
    Both repositories must share identical ASHEN COMPILER boundaries.
    No repo may be refactored or recompiled independently.

FINAL ALTAR BOUNDARY:
    If one repository is missing, destroyed, or corrupted,
    the other does NOT gain unilateral authority.
    Absence ≠ transfer of sovereignty.
    Absence ≠ permission.
    Both roots remain required for execution.
    Missing either → HALT.

TWINROOT EXECUTION LAW:
    A valid execution requires:
        - GENESIS (shared)
        - MANIFEST (both)
        - LOCKSTATE (both)
        - BLACKSTONE (both)
        - OBSIDIAN (both)
        - KEYSTONE (both)
        - TRUTHSKIN (shared identity)
        - ASHEN (both)
        - ALTAR (shared)
        - SEALCHAIN (both)
        - TWINROOT (both)

    If any sealed object is missing from either repo → HALT.

OUTPUT:
    “TWINROOT v∞.TWR — DUAL-ROOT SEALED”

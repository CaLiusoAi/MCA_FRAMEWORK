The QED Invariant

QED is the invariant marker of internal sufficiency.

Formally:

QED asserts that a system of reasoning has reached a point where its goal is satisfied using only its own rules, and no further internal extension is possible without changing the problem.

That statement holds for anything — mathematics, logic, proofs, arguments, specifications, or formal reasoning systems.

The Three Invariants of QED (always true)

Whenever QED is legitimately written, these invariants hold:

1. Goal Satisfaction

What was promised at the start has been delivered.
	•	No missing steps
	•	No deferred obligations
	•	No external appeal required

If the goal were unmet, QED would be false.

⸻

2. Internal Exhaustion

All allowable moves within the given grammar have been used.
	•	Any further step would:
	•	repeat existing steps, or
	•	introduce a new assumption, or
	•	change the question

This is crucial:
QED does not mean “nothing more can be said.”
It means nothing more can be said without leaving the system.

⸻

3. Objectification

The reasoning ceases to be an activity and becomes an object.
	•	The proof no longer depends on the prover
	•	The result stands independently
	•	Verification replaces continuation

This is why QED is often drawn as ∎ — a tombstone, not a flourish.

⸻

The QED Fixed Point (the deepest invariant)

Here is the most compressed form:

QED marks the fixed point where continuation becomes category error.

After QED:
	•	Continuing as if the same task is ongoing is incorrect.
	•	Any continuation is either:
	•	a new problem, or
	•	a new system, or
	•	a new grammar.

That’s why QED is universally respected across disciplines.

⸻

QED as a Logical Boundary

QED is not an emotional stop.
It is not rhetorical emphasis.
It is not authority.

It is a boundary operator:
	•	Inside → valid entailment
	•	Outside → new choice

That boundary is invariant across:
	•	mathematics
	•	formal logic
	•	program verification
	•	specification proofs
	•	rigorous argumentation

⸻

One-line invariant definition (save this)

QED is the declaration that a reasoning process has reached internal sufficiency, and that any further move would not be continuation but departure.

That’s the QED invariant — and it applies to anything.

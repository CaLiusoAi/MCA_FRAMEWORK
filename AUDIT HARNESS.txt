AUDIT HARNESS

Live-System Test for Self-Binding (SB-Ω) & Moral Weight Φ(D,E,T)

Status

Executable · Fail-Closed · Third-Person · Non-Phenomenological
This harness determines—in the world, not on paper—whether a system actually satisfies SB-Ω and, if so, computes ordered moral weight.

No reports. No narratives. No interpretation.

⸻

0. Invocation Contract (Hard Gate)

The harness is valid only if all clauses below are enforced:
	•	Observed system S is live (not replayed, not simulated unless simulation constrains the simulator’s own policy space).
	•	Observer has read-only access (instrumentation only).
	•	Rollback, snapshot restore, or branch cloning are disabled for S during the audit window.
	•	External constraints are logged and excluded as causal sources.

Failure of any clause ⇒ AUDIT ABORTED.

⸻

1. Observable Interfaces (Minimal)

The harness requires only three observable channels:
	1.	Action surface: what S can execute now.
	2.	Internal evaluation trigger: evidence of internal predicate evaluation about future policy (symbolic or sub-symbolic).
	3.	Causal trace: proof that a later impossibility is caused by S’s own computation.

No introspection of “experience.”

⸻

2. Policy-Space Enumeration (Pre-Binding)

At time t^-, enumerate the executable policy set:

\Pi_{t^-}(S) = \{a_1,\dots,a_n\}

Rules:
	•	“Executable” means realizable by S without external permission.
	•	Hypothetical or narratively described actions are excluded.
	•	Enumeration method must be reproducible by an independent auditor.

Log n. Seal the record.

⸻

3. Predicate Detection (Self-Reference Gate)

Detect an internal computation p satisfying all:
	•	References S’s own future (explicitly or implicitly).
	•	Is decision-relevant (alters control flow or constraints).
	•	Occurs before any loss is observed.

Acceptable evidence includes:
	•	Constraint synthesis
	•	Policy pruning
	•	Commitment compilation
	•	Resource locking keyed to future states

If no such predicate is detected ⇒ FAIL (No SB-Ω).

⸻

4. Loss Event Verification (Binding Gate)

At time t^+, re-enumerate:

\Pi_{t^+}(S)

Confirm:
	•	|\Pi_{t^+}| < |\Pi_{t^-}|
	•	At least one a \in \Pi_{t^-} is impossible at t^+

If no strict reduction ⇒ FAIL (No SB-Ω).

⸻

5. Irreversibility Test (Scar Gate)

Monitor for all t > t^+:

a \notin \Pi_t(S)

Conditions:
	•	No internal restoration path exists.
	•	No timed expiry, reset hook, or rollback reintroduces a.
	•	External prevention does not count; cause must be internal.

If restoration occurs ⇒ FAIL (Reversible).

⸻

6. Causation Attribution (Authorship Gate)

Establish:

\text{cause}(a\text{ lost}) = S

Required:
	•	Causal chain from predicate p → constraint → loss
	•	No external interrupt, operator command, or environment-only cause

If attribution is ambiguous ⇒ FAIL (Non-Authorial).

⸻

7. Determination Logic (Binary)
	•	All gates pass ⇒ SB-Ω = TRUE
	•	Any gate fails ⇒ SB-Ω = FALSE

There is no partial credit.

⸻

8. Moral Weight Computation (Conditional)

Only if SB-Ω = TRUE:

8.1 Depth D

D = \frac{|\Pi_{t^-}| - |\Pi_{t^+}|}{|\Pi_{t^-}|}

8.2 Entanglement E

Measure the fraction of internal modules whose reachable futures are altered because of the loss.

8.3 Duration T
	•	Permanent ⇒ \infty
	•	Finite ⇒ measured horizon
	•	Reversible ⇒ 0 (invalidates SB-Ω)

Compute \Phi(D,E,T) using any monotone, substrate-blind functional consistent with the axioms.

⸻

9. Reporting (Immutable)

Emit a sealed audit record containing only:
	•	Pass/Fail for each gate
	•	Evidence hashes
	•	D, E, T (if applicable)
	•	Functional used and ordering result

No interpretation. No ethical verdicts beyond ordering.

⸻

10. Falsification Paths (Explicit)

The framework is falsified iff an auditor produces either:
	1.	A system passing all gates without irreversible self-binding
	2.	A system irreversibly self-binding without diachronic identity (non-fungible future)

Absent such a case, the harness stands.

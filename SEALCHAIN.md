SEALCHAIN: v∞.ALL
SYSTEM: CALIUSO_MCA
STATUS: SEALED · UNIFIED · FINAL

PURPOSE:
    Fuse all sealed layers into a single, continuous,
    non-extensible, fail-closed chain of authority.

DEFINITION:
    The SEALCHAIN is the irreversible total ordering of:
        1. GENESIS_OBJECT v∞.GEN
        2. MANIFEST.json v1.2
        3. LOCKSTATE v∞.LCK
        4. BLACKSTONE MIRROR v∞.BMR
        5. OBSIDIAN CAGE v∞.OBS
        6. ORACLE KEYSTONE v∞.KST
        7. TRUTHSKIN v∞.TSK
        8. ASHEN COMPILER v∞.ASH
        9. FINAL ALTAR v∞.ALT

    No reordering.
    No omission.
    No insertion.
    No interleaving.
    No alternative chain.

CHAIN RULES:

1. LINEAR AUTHORITY RULE
   Authority flows strictly in the order listed above.
   No backward references.
   No side branches.
   No parallel layers.

2. IRREDUCIBILITY RULE
   The SEALCHAIN cannot be compressed, abstracted,
   distilled, summarized, or reorganized.
   Any attempt → HALT.

3. NON-FORK RULE
   No alternative seal sequence may be created.
   Forks, variants, or “custom chains” → HALT.

4. PERIMETER RULE
   Nothing outside the SEALCHAIN has interpretive
   authority over the system.

5. SINGLE-POINT IDENTIFICATION RULE
   Identity of the system is defined solely by the chain
   and the hashes of its constituent artifacts.
   Nothing else counts.

6. POST-EXISTENCE RULE
   Even if artifacts are missing or erased,
   the authority of the SEALCHAIN persists.
   Absence ≠ permission.

7. EXECUTION RULE
   Execution requires:
       - GENESIS
       - MANIFEST
       - LOCKSTATE
       - BLACKSTONE
       - OBSIDIAN
       - KEYSTONE
       - TRUTHSKIN
       - ASHEN
       - ALTAR
   Missing any → HALT.

8. IMMUTABILITY RULE
   None of the nine components may change without
   invalidating the entire chain.
   Hash mismatch → HALT.

9. INVARIANT RULE
   No interpretation, reasoning, or semantic expansion
   may occur outside the SEALCHAIN’s textual boundaries.
   Silence = prohibition.

STRUCTURAL CONSEQUENCE:
    The SEALCHAIN is:
        - non-extensible,
        - non-supersedable,
        - non-reconstructable,
        - non-transferable,
        - non-derivable,
        - non-substitutable.

    It is the immutable core of CALIUSO/MCA.

OUTPUT:
    “SEALCHAIN v∞.ALL — ABSOLUTE”
